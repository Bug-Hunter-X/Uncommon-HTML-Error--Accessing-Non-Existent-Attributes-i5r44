# Uncommon HTML Error: Accessing Non-Existent Attributes

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in HTML when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on an element.  While straightforward errors are easily caught, this type of error can be more challenging to track down. The bug involves accessing a non-existent attribute of an HTML element which can result in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The bug arises when JavaScript code attempts to access an attribute that is not defined within the HTML.  This might happen due to a typo, a change in the HTML structure, or because the attribute's presence depends on dynamic elements or external data loading.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling. It's crucial to check if the attribute exists before trying to access it. The `hasOwnProperty()` method or optional chaining (`?.`) can be used for this check to prevent errors and improve code robustness.
